/*
 * The purpose of this test is to test when we join and our children have
 * already quit.  One will be done where we have been zapped before calling
 * join, one will be done where we have not bee zapped before calling join.
 * Possible expected output 
 * start1(): started
 * start1(): after fork of child 3
 * start1(): after fork of child 4
 * start1(): after fork of child 5
 * start1(): performing first join
 * XXp1(): started
 * XXp1(): arg = `XXp1'
 * XXp4(): started
 * XXp4(): arg = `XXp4FromXXp1'
 * XXp2(): started
 * XXp2(): arg = `XXp2'
 * XXp2(): calling zap(5)
 * XXp3(): started
 * XXp3(): arg = `XXp3'
 * XXp4(): started
 * XXp4(): arg = `XXp4FromXXp3a'
 * XXp1(): after fork of child 6
 * XXp1(): performing first join
 * XXp1(): exit status for child 6 is -4
 * start1(): exit status for child 3 is -1
 * start1(): performing second join
 * XXp3(): after fork of child 7
 * XXp4(): started
 * XXp4(): arg = `XXp4FromXXp3b'
 * XXp3(): after fork of child 8
 * XXp3(): performing first join
 * XXp3(): exit status for child -1 is -4
 * XXp3(): performing second join
 * XXp3(): exit status for child -1 is -4
 * start1(): exit status for child 5 is -3
 * start1(): performing third join
 * XXp2(): return value of zap(5) is 0
 * start1(): exit status for child 4 is -2
 * All processes completed.
 * 
 * Due to round robin and time slice 
 * Some other version could take place
 * Expected output:
 * start1(): started
 * start1(): after fork of child 3
 * start1(): after fork of child 4
 * start1(): after fork of child 5
 * start1(): performing first join
 * XXp1(): started
 * XXp1(): arg = `XXp1()'
 * XXp4(): started
 * XXp4(): arg = `XXp4FromXXp1'
 * XXp1(): after fork of child 6
 * XXp1(): performing first join
 * XXp1(): exit status for child 6 is -4
 * start1(): exit status for child 3 is -1
 * start1(): performing second join
 * XXp2(): started
 * XXp2(): arg = `XXp2'
 * XXp2(): calling zap(5)
